    "Any mix of dynamic/static generation and dynamic/static acquisition is good. \n",

    "__Def Static generation__ : \n",
    "Static generation places a single pattern on the configured channels. Static generation, like static acquisition, is controlled by software and does not use hardware timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a function call is required for each data point generated, static generation is generally used only for single-point or low-speed applications. Static generation can be helpful in system and cable debugging, DC-level semiconductor testing, and many other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static generation is also called immediate, unstrobed, or nonlatched generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Def Dynamic generation__ : \n",
    "Dynamic generation is a clocked operation where binary data is sent from the NI device to the DUT (device under test, I belive this is the black box that serves as a breakout) across multiple digital channels. The data can be generated based on complex scripts, and it can react to triggers, generate markers, and be shifted in time with respect to the generating clock. \n",
    "\n",
    "For NI 6541/6542 devices Dynamic Generation is only supported in Active Drive mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Conclusion__ From the above, it seems we want to set up our output channels to use dynamic generation, so we can script the timing, rather than rely on precise timing in python. It would apprear that this can be best implemented using \"scripts\" (as specifically defined in the NI documentation) for our use case.\n",
